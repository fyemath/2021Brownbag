# A Practical Guide to Markdown and Tools

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) is a lightweight markup language that can be used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents It is the popular markup language that people use it to create websites, documents, books, and presentations. For example, [my website](https://yfei.page), and those [online books and slides](https://yfei.page/teaching/#books) were built using markdown or its extension R markdown.

In this presentation, I will introduce the syntax of Markdown, the easy to use editor [Typora](https://typora.io/), the universal document converter [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), and the cloud computing and website hosting platform [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/drop). If time permits, I will also introduce the version control system [git](https://git-scm.com/), the repository hosting platform [GitHub](https://github.com/),  the app [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

By the end of this talk, participants will be able to 

1. write in Markdown, 
2. use Typora and Pandoc to create a webpage, a word document, a pdf file, and a presentation (html or ppt) from a Markdown file, and
3. use Hugo to create a website (or blogsite) and publish it.
